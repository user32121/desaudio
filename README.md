A small project that allows using Desmos as an audio generator.

Simply copy the contents of [script.js](script.js) into the console of a [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) page.

The script defines a list `t_{desaudio}`, so any transformations to it (e.g. `\sin\left(2\pi440t_{desaudio}\right)`) can be played as audio.
